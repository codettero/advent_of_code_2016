Advent of Code 2016
===================
This is a central repository which brings together solutions for the AoC'16 challenges, in various programming languages, as implemented by the Codette community. 

If you are a member of the Codette community, this is the perfect place for you to either contribute to existing solutions or to add your own. This repository is meant as a document of the fun we have had, solving these challenges, and learning along the way. 

It is important to note that this repository is not meant to be a reflection of the best ways in which each of these challenges can be solved, in each programming language we've attampted. Rather, it's a historical aggregate that we can look back on.

Even if AoC'16 will end at the end of December, you can contribute to solutions to these challenges at any time, provided that you are a Codette member.
The core mechanism for contributions is the pull request.
